*Simple Secure Chat (SSC)*  
*Fall 2012*  

**Description**  
Secure Chat application over TCP/IP that uses RSA for pre-chat transactions  
and AES in CBC mode for in-chat transactions.

Please check out the [Downloads](https://bitbucket.org/vestrel00/security-project/downloads) page for a runnable client and server jar file and other stuff.

**P.S.**  
1. Note that I coded everything in a rapid-prototyping kind of way. Therefore, the code can be optimized and be made more readable in some places.

2. I've documented everything so you may get away with browsing my source without having to read lines of code. Just read documentation to avoid headache!
