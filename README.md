# CS480 Project by Estrellado, Vandolf
*Simple Secure Chat (SSC)*  
*Fall 2012*  

**Description**  
Secure Chat application over TCP/IP that uses RSA for pre-chat transactions  
and AES in CBC mode for in-chat transactions.

Please check out the [Downloads](https://bitbucket.org/vestrel00/security-project/downloads) page for a runnable client and server jar file and other stuff.

**P.S.**  

1. Note that I coded everything in a rapid-prototyping kind of way.   
   Therefore, the code can be optimized and be made more readable in some places.  
2. I've documented everything so you may get away with browsing my source   
   without having to read lines of code. Just read documentation to avoid headache!  
3. The size of the repo is over 30mb because I actually commited the LibGdx  
   library in the beginning with plans to make a client GUI and android port.   
   Then I also forgot to include a .gitignore, which led to binaries   
   (.class, .jar, etc) being tracked. I just recently fixed all this but the size   
   of the repo will not change T_T so you might want to just download the source   
   rather than fork the repo if you want to use this for what ever reason.
