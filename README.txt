CS480 Project by Estrellado, Vandolf
Simple Secure Chat (SSC)
Fall 2012


Source code for the server implementation is in sscServer folder.
Source code for the client implementation is in sscClient folder.

SSC folder contains the gui source code (which I might remove from from my todo list)

Note that I coded everything in a rapid-prototyping kind of way. I could change the structure to make it more readable and understandable, and optimized, but I think I've spent way too much time on this already so I'll just keep going with what I have...
