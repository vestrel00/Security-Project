*READ THE ENTIRE THING PLEASE*

Source code for the server implementation is in sscServer folder.
Source code for the client implementation is in sscClient folder.

Note that I coded everything in a rapid-prototyping kind of way. 
I could change the structure to make it more readable and understandable, 
and optimized, but I think I've spent way too much time on this already 
so I'll just keep going with what I have...

I've documented everything so you may get away with browsing my source 
without having to read lines of code. Just read documentation to avoid headache!

P.S.
I said that I would do a GUI but I think I've spent too much time on this already. 
I haven't been developing my game at all this month so I guess I'll just stick with the command line!
