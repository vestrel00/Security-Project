*READ THE ENTIRE THING PLEASE*

I use Eclipse IDE.
Source code for the server implementation is in sscServer folder.
Source code for the client implementation is in sscClient folder.

Note that I coded everything in a rapid-prototyping kind of way. 
I could change the structure to make it more readable and understandable, 
and optimized, but I think I've spent way too much time on this already 
so I'll just keep going with what I have...

I've documented everything so you may get away with browsing my source 
without having to read lines of code. Just read documentation to avoid headache!

Refer to TODO.txt to see what is still left to be done.
Refer to MANUAL.txt for instructions on how to run this though should be obvious.

P.S.
I said that I would do a GUI but I think I've spent too much time on this already. 
I haven't been developing my game at all this month so I guess I'll just stick with the command line!
