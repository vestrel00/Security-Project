Simple Secure Chat (SSC)
Fall 2012
TODO List

1)	See SSCServiceStandard.
2)	Add a hash to RSA pre-chat transactions.

4)	IMPORTANT! 
	Mistake in implementation of login authentication using hashed passwords!
	Currently: (WRONG!)
		storing (H(salt + pass), salt) in the DB (Database)
		sending the salt to user on login
		user sends H(salt + pass)
		compare user sent and stored saltedHashedPass in DB
		This does not prevent an offline dictionary attack if attacker has access to DB
	Must change to:
		correct implementation (lol)

5)	Instead of storing the hashedPassword, store the password that is hashed 100,000 times!
	Make the client do the work! not the server!
	- So server sends salt stored in DB to client.
	- client concats the salt with the password from user input. 
	- client hashes (salt+password) 100,000 times
 	- client sends hash to server
	- server looks up the stored hashed^100,000 times in the DB and authenticates
	Point is to make the client do the hashing - not the server.
