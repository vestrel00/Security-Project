The following are just notes for myself.

There was a "bug" that took me an entire day to guess a working fix.
I'm not sure if its a bug with the JDK or it is caused by the lack of synchronization
of things when there are multiple threads.

Anyways the following does not work the way I expect it to.
while(condition)
	continue;
Once the condition is false, the next line of code after continue is not executed.

FIX:
while(condition){
	System.out.flush();
	continue;
}
The above fixes the "blocking" so execution does not stop. However, I never use
System.out other than for printing debug messages using System.out.println();
So why does System.out.flush(); need to be called??? I only got this fix though an entire
day of trial and error / testing.
